# Hi there 👋

My name is [Peter](https://www.petershin.dev), and I like to make things.

## Always learning new things, and currently working on:

1. Learning as much about AI as possible before it takes over.
2. Building AI applications so that I can control it before it takes over.
3. Talking nicely to it so that it doesn't see me as a threat when it takes over.

## What I'm currently working on and/or learning: 
1. Remote Coder, open-source project. For the power users, the grinders, the I-gotta-work-rn kind of people.
1. Rust because I want to learn systems-level programming without the C++ headache. [Advent of Code with Python and Rust](https://github.com/PeterShin23/aoc-2025)
1. Fine-tuning LLMs using PyTorch because AI Engineering is a big interest.

## Some of my work:

1. [Remote Coder aka Pocket Intern](https://orcaflow.dev) - Slack-first daemon that interacts with local coding agents via Slack threads and makes PRs to GitHub remote repository.
1. [VLM Bounding Box](https://nbviewer.org/github/PeterShin23/vlm-bounding-box/blob/main/notebooks/train_qwen3_refcoco.ipynb) - Training Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct model to draw bounding box around subject.
1. [SeatGeek MCP Server](https://github.com/PeterShin23/seatgeek-mcp) - An MCP Server that connects you to the SeatGeek Public Developer API. Helps you find events using tool-enabled LLMs.
1. [LLM Assistant](https://github.com/PeterShin23/MyAssistant) - A CLI assistant written in Go that anticipates what you need help with and... helps you with them. Even stream the help to a mobile device compatible with Expo.

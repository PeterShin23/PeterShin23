# Hi there 👋

My name is [Peter](https://peter-shin.vercel.app), and I like to make things.

## Always learning new things, and currently working on:

1. Learning as much about AI as possible before it takes over.
2. Building AI applications so that I can control it before it takes over.
3. Talking nicely to it so that it doesn't see me as a threat when it takes over.

## Some of my work:

1. [SeatGeek MCP Server](https://github.com/PeterShin23/seatgeek-mcp) - An MCP Server that connects you to the SeatGeek Public Developer API. Helps you find events using tool-enabled LLMs.
1. [LLM Assistant](https://github.com/PeterShin23/MyAssistant) - A CLI assistant written in Go that anticipates what you need help with and... helps you with them.
2. [No Meal Plan](https://github.com/PeterShin23/food-vision) - A mobile app written in React Native that scans your fridge, identifies ingredients using computer vision, and generates a recipe.
3. [Auto Photo Portfolio](https://tinyurl.com/yf6hvufm) - A full stack app written in React with AWS serverless backend that takes your instagram media and generates a website for it. (Want to rework this for simpler deployment)

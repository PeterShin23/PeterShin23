# Hi there 👋

My name is [Peter](https://www.petershin.dev), and I like to make things.

## Always learning new things, and currently working on:

1. Learning as much about AI as possible before it takes over.
2. Building AI applications so that I can control it before it takes over.
3. Talking nicely to it so that it doesn't see me as a threat when it takes over.

## What I'm currently working/learning on: **Fine-Tuning LLM with PyTorch**
I would like to admit that back in college, I wasn't that interested in how AI works, but now that LLMs are everywhere, I couldn't help but get interested in it. I've been reading a lot of papers, and the way they work and learn are so brilliant and intuitive. Makes me appreciate Linear Algebra and Probability a lot more than I did back in college for sure. Check out the first item below! It's me trying to learn PyTorch and fine-tune a Vision Language Model from Alibaba.

## Some of my work:

1. [Remote Coder aka Pocket Intern](https://github.com/PeterShin23/remote-coder) - Slack-first daemon that interacts with local coding agents via Slack threads and makes PRs to GitHub remote repository.
1. [VLM Bounding Box](https://nbviewer.org/github/PeterShin23/vlm-bounding-box/blob/main/notebooks/train_qwen3_refcoco.ipynb) - Training Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct model to draw bounding box around subject.
1. [SeatGeek MCP Server](https://github.com/PeterShin23/seatgeek-mcp) - An MCP Server that connects you to the SeatGeek Public Developer API. Helps you find events using tool-enabled LLMs.
1. [LLM Assistant](https://github.com/PeterShin23/MyAssistant) - A CLI assistant written in Go that anticipates what you need help with and... helps you with them. Even stream the help to a mobile device compatible with Expo.
2. [No Meal Plan](https://github.com/PeterShin23/food-vision) - A mobile app written in React Native that scans your fridge, identifies ingredients using computer vision, and generates a recipe.
3. [Auto Photo Portfolio](https://tinyurl.com/yf6hvufm) - A full stack app written in React with AWS serverless backend that takes your instagram media and generates a website for it. (Want to rework this for simpler deployment)
